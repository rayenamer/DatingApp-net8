üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The architecture of an ASP.NET Core 8 API project is organized into distinct layers to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. It includes:

1. Controllers

Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses. Each controller corresponds to a specific resource or functionality, such as user management or messaging.
2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

Used to transfer data between the client and server. DTOs help shape the data sent over the network, ensuring that only necessary information is exposed.
3. Data Layer

Interacts with the database through repositories. This layer encapsulates the logic for accessing data sources, allowing for easy data manipulation and retrieval.
4. Entities

Defines the core business models of the application. Entities represent the data structure and are mapped to the database tables.
5. Error Handling

Manages exceptions and errors that occur during execution, providing a consistent response format for error messages.
6. Middleware

Handles cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and exception handling, ensuring that these functionalities are applied consistently across the application.
7. Services

Contains business logic and operations that are not directly related to data access. Services interact with repositories and perform operations on the data.
8. SignalR

Enables real-time web functionality, allowing for bi-directional communication between the server and clients.
This layered architecture ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable application design, making it easier to manage and extend the project as requirements evolve.
